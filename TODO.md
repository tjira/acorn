# TODO List

- [ ] The resampling within unSMASH algorithm should probably not resample all the spheres if resampling during jump.
- [ ] Implement the TDC using the logarithm of U.
- [ ] Implement the function that generates all combinations using GSL instead of my shitty function.
- [ ] Make the OpenBLAS library compile with arbitrary number of cores, not just the number of cores of the current machine.
