# TODO List

- [x] The resampling within unSMASH algorithm should probably not resample all the spheres if resampling during jump.
- [x] Implement the TDC using the logarithm of U.
- [ ] Implement the function that generates all combinations using GSL instead of my shitty function.
- [x] Make the OpenBLAS library compile with arbitrary number of cores, not just the number of cores of the current machine.
- [x] Fix the bug when loading integrals from disk, the basis still needs to be specified.
- [x] Make the Eigen tensor contraction parallel.
- [ ] Velocity and acceleration in lambda TSH should be in the direction of motion for higher dimensional systems.
- [x] Check if i really need to store both J_AO and J_AO_A for the HF method.
- [x] The coefficient matrix from GHF is not necessarily in a,b,a,b order, which might mess up following calcualtions.
- [ ] Better integrator for the Bohmian trajectories so that the trajectories would not lag behind.
- [x] Bohmian dynamics should have an option to output only the mean trajectories.
- [x] Multidimensional Bohmian dynamics.
- [x] Maybe do some better field interpolation than nearest neighbour for the Bohmian trajectories.
- [x] Resolve the correct weighing in MASH algorithm.
- [x] Should I weigh also the other observables like energy in MASH algorithm?
- [ ] Check the suspicious sign in front of TDC during formation of MASH propagation matrix.
- [x] The propagators in QD do not have to be reallocated every time, they can be just rewritten when using time-dependent Hamiltonian.
- [ ] Landau-Zener scattering matrix doesnt work for multiple crossings.
- [x] The Landau-Zener scattering matrix needs derivative of the diabatic enegy gap, not the adiabatic.
- [ ] The hamiltonian specification from file is kind of junk and it doesn't support higher dimensions.
- [x] Check the propagate function if the derivatives are calculated at the correct points.
- [ ] Time derivative coupling using NACV in ab initio dynamics is problematic since the coefficient propagation is wrong due to big time step.
- [x] Implement ab inition dynamics with multiple initial conditions.
- [ ] Implement Boltzmann sampling for the initial conditions in ab initio dynamics.
- [ ] Implement parallelization for classical dynamics.
- [ ] The AIMD code is currently unparallelizable due to file reading.
- [ ] Degrees of freedom in AIMD should are always 3*N - 6
