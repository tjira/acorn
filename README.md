## Features

Below are all the important features of Acorn divided into categories.

### Quantum Mechanical Methods

* Hartree-Fock Method
* Møller–Plesset Perturbation Theory
* Numerically Exact Quantum Dynamics

### Additional Calculations

* Gradients, Hessians and Frequency Analysis

## Compilation

The software requires the [libint](https://github.com/evaleev/libint) library. Before the library compilation process, make sure you have [eigen](https://gitlab.com/libeigen/eigen) and [boost](https://github.com/boostorg/boost) installed. On debian-based distributions, you can do it with the following command.

```bash
sudo apt install libboost-dev libeigen3-dev
```

To compile the library execute `./script/libint.sh` from the project root directory. This command creates the *libint* folder with the compiled library. Now, we export the necessary environment variables.

```bash
export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH="$PWD/libint/install/include:$CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH"
export LIBRARY_PATH="$PWD/libint/install/lib:$LIBRARY_PATH"
```

After this, the project configuration should finish without errors.

```bash
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
```

And we can build with the following command.

```bash
cmake --build build
```

After the compilation the bin folder will be created along with the executable.

## Examples

All the example inputs are located in the `example/input` folder. They are meant to be kept there due to the relative paths to the molecules. If you are in the project root directory, you can run one of the examples as `./bin/acorn example/input/rhf.json` and the calculation should start. Feel free to explore all the examples.
