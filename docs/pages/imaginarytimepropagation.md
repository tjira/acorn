# Imaginary Time Propagation

Imaginary time propagation is a numerical technique used to find the ground state of a quantum system by evolving it in imaginary time instead of real time. By replacing time with an imaginary variable, higher energy states decay exponentially, leaving only the lowest-energy state. This method is widely used in quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics to determine electronic and nuclear ground states. However, like real time propagation, its applicability is limited to small systems due to the high computational cost of solving the underlying equations.
