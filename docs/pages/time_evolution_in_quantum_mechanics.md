# Time Evolution in Quantum Mechanics<!--\label{sec:time_evolution}-->

Quantum dynamics describes the evolution of quantum systems over time and is fundamental in quantum chemistry for understanding molecular behavior at the atomic level. It is governed by the principles of quantum mechanics, particularly the timedependent Schr√∂dinger equation, which dictates how wavefunctions change with time. Due to the complex nature of these equations, practical solutions are often limited to small or model systems.

There are two main approaches to quantum dynamics: real time propagation and imaginary time propagation. Real time propagation follows the natural evolution of a system in time, making it crucial for studying dynamic processes such as chemical reactions, electronic excitations, and non-equilibrium phenomena. Imaginary time propagation, on the other hand, is used to find the ground state of a quantum system by evolving it in an artificial imaginary time direction, gradually filtering out higher energy states. While these techniques provide deep insights into molecular quantum behavior, their application is restricted to relatively small or model systems due to the exponential increase in computational cost with system size.
