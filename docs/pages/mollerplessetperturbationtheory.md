# Møller--Plesset Perturbation Theory

Møller--Plesset Perturbation Theory is a quantum mechanical method used to improve the accuracy of electronic structure calculations within the framework of Hartree--Fock theory. It involves treating electron-electron correlation effects as a perturbation to the reference Hartree--Fock wave function. The method is named after its developers, physicists C. Møller and M. S. Plesset. By systematically including higher-order corrections, Møller--Plesset Perturbation Theory provides more accurate predictions of molecular properties compared to the initial Hartree--Fock approximation.

## Theory of the Pertrubative Approach

As for the Hartree--Fock method, we start with the Schrödinger equation in the form

\begin{equation}
\hat{\mathbf{H}}\ket{\Psi}=E\ket{\Psi},
\end{equation}

where $\hat{\mathbf{H}}$ is the molecular Hamiltonian operator, $\ket{\Psi}$ is the molecular wave function, and $E$ is the total energy of the system. In the Møller--Plesset perturbation theory we write the Hamiltonian operator as

\begin{equation}
\hat{\mathbf{H}}=\hat{\mathbf{H}}^{(0)}+\lambda\hat{\mathbf{H}}^{'},
\end{equation}

where $\hat{\mathbf{H}}^{(0)}$ is the Hamiltonian used in the Hartree--Fock method (the electrons are moving in the mean field), $\lambda$ is a parameter between 0 and 1, and $\hat{\mathbf{H}}^{'}$ is the perturbation operator representing the missing electron-electron interactions. We can then expand the wavefunction $\ket{\Psi}$ and total energy $E$ in a power series of $\lambda$ as

\begin{align}
\ket{\Psi}&=\ket{\Psi^{(0)}}+\lambda\ket{\Psi^{(1)}}+\lambda^2\ket{\Psi^{(2)}}+\dots \\\\\
E&=E^{(0)}+\lambda E^{(1)}+\lambda^2 E^{(2)}+\dots
\end{align}

and ask, how how does the total energy change with the included terms. After some algebra, we can show that the first order correction to the total energy is zero, the second order correction is given by

\begin{equation}
E_{corr}^{MP2}=\sum\_{s>0}\frac{H\_{0s}^{'}H\_{s0}^{'}}{E\_0-E\_s},
\end{equation}

where $s$ runs over all doubly excited determinants, $H\_{0s}^{'}$ is the matrix element of the perturbation operator between the Hartree--Fock determinant and the doubly excited determinant, and $E\_0$ and $E\_s$ are the energies of the reference and doubly excited determinants, respectively.<!--\cite{10.1002/wcms.58,1014569052}--> We could express all higher-order corrections in a similar way, using only the matrix elements of the perturbation operator and the energies of the determinants. For practical calculations, we apply Slater-Condon rules to evaluate the matrix elements and use the orbital energies obtained from the Hartree--Fock calculation. The expressions for calculation are summarised below.

## Implementation of 2nd and 3rd Order Corrections

Having the antisymmetrized Coulomb integrals in the MS basis and physicists' notation defined [here](hartreefockmethod.html#the-integral-transforms), we can now proceed with the calculation of the correlation energy. We wil use the convention, that the indices $i$, $j$, $k$, and $l$ run over occupied spinorbitals, while the indices $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ run over virtual spinorbitals. The 2nd order and 3rd

\begin{equation}
E_{corr}^{MP2}=\frac{1}{4}\sum_{ijab}\frac{\braket{ab||ij}\braket{ij||ab}}{\varepsilon_i+\varepsilon_j-\varepsilon_a-\varepsilon_b}
\end{equation}

The 3rd order correlation energy:

\begin{align}
E_{corr}^{MP3}=&\frac{1}{8}\sum_{ijab}\frac{\braket{ab||ij}\braket{cd||ab}\braket{ij||cd}}{(\varepsilon_i+\varepsilon_j-\varepsilon_a-\varepsilon_b)(\varepsilon_i+\varepsilon_j-\varepsilon_c-\varepsilon_d)}+\nonumber \\\\\
&+\frac{1}{8}\sum_{ijab}\frac{\braket{ab||ij}\braket{ij||kl}\braket{kl||ab}}{(\varepsilon_i+\varepsilon_j-\varepsilon_a-\varepsilon_b)(\varepsilon_k+\varepsilon_l-\varepsilon_a-\varepsilon_b)}+\nonumber \\\\\
&+\sum_{ijab}\frac{\braket{ab||ij}\braket{cj||kb}\braket{ik||ac}}{(\varepsilon_i+\varepsilon_j-\varepsilon_a-\varepsilon_b)(\varepsilon_i+\varepsilon_k-\varepsilon_a-\varepsilon_c)}
\end{align}

To calculate the 4th order correction, we would need to write 39 terms, which is not practical. Higher-order corrections are usually not programmed this way, instead, the diagrammatic approach is used.<!--\cite{1014569052,10.1016/0010-4655!73!90016-7,10.1016/0010-4655!73!90017-9}-->

## Code Examples

In a similar fashion to the Hartree--Fock method, we can implement the Møller--Plesset perturbation theory in Python. The code below first proposes a self-contained exercise to calculate the Møller--Plesset Perturbation Theory of 2nd Order and Møller--Plesset Perturbation Theory of 3rd Order correlation energies. The solution is then provided in the following code snippet. You should append the code after your Hartree--Fock implementation, since the MP2 and MP3 methods are built on top of the Hartree--Fock method so should have already completed the Hartree--Fock calculations [here](hartreefockmethod.html#code-examples).

### Exercise

In the exercise, you are expected to calculate the Møller--Plesset Perturbation Theory of 2nd Order and Møller--Plesset Perturbation Theory of 3rd Order correlation energies. The exercise is provided in the Listing <!--\ref{code:mp_exercise}--> below.

<!--{id=code:mp_exercise caption="Møller--Plesset Perturbation Theory of 2nd Order and Møller--Plesset Perturbation Theory of 3rd Order exercise code."}-->
```python
"""
Since we have everything we need for the MP calculations, we can now calculate the MP2 correlation energy. The result should be stored in the "E_MP2" variable.
"""
E_MP2 = 0

"""

"""
E_MP3 = 0

# print the results
print("MP2 ENERGY: {:.8f}".format(E_HF + E_MP2 +       + VNN))
print("MP3 ENERGY: {:.8f}".format(E_HF + E_MP2 + E_MP3 + VNN))
