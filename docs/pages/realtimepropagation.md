# Real Time Propagation

Real time propagation is a computational approach used to study the time evolution of quantum systems according to the time dependent Schrödinger equation. It is essential for modeling dynamic processes such as electronic excitations, molecular vibrations, and non equilibrium phenomena in quantum chemistry. By solving the wavefunction’s evolution step by step in real time, this method captures transient states and ultrafast reactions. However, due to the exponential growth of computational complexity, real time propagation is feasible only for small systems or simplified models.
