"""
This educational script is designed to compute the Hartree-Fock energy, MP2 correlation energy and the FCI energy for a specified molecule. It requires that the molecule.xyz file and all integral files be located in the same directory as the script, though adjustments can easily be made. The script is structured into four main sections.

In the first section, the script loads the molecule and integral data. This section is intended to remain unaltered by students.

In the second section, the script performs the Hartree-Fock calculation. Students are expected to complete the while loop with the appropriate calculations. The calculation of the nuclear-nuclear repulsion energy is also requested.

The third section is dedicated to the MP2 calculation. Here, students need to transform the Coulomb integrals to the molecular orbital basis and compute the MP2 correlation energy.

The fourth and final section involves the FCI (Full Configuration Interaction) calculation. Students should transform the required integrals into the molecular spinorbital basis, generate all possible electron determinants, and apply the Slater-Condon rules to construct the CI Hamiltonian.

However, should we decide to implement methods like CIS, CID, or CISD, we could easily limit the number of excitations. Itâ€™s important to remember that for all CI methods, the rest of the code remains unchanged. The only difference lies in the determinants used. Donâ€™t overcomplicate this.

This arrangement allows you to easily determine the number of unique spinorbitals based on the rule being applied, meaning you will always know how many entries at the beginning of the array are unique spinorbitals. While you can develop your own method for managing this array, I will proceed under the assumption that the Slater-Condon rules we use will take a single array of spinorbitals and return an unsigned matrix element. The sign of this element will be corrected later in the script. For simplicity and flexibility, I'll define these rules using lambda functions, but you're welcome to expand them into full functions if you prefer.
